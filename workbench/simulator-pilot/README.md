# SH4 paired-execution pilot

This is an optional diagnostic experiment, not a decompilation acceptance gate.
It uses the unmodified [sh4objtest v0.1.48](https://github.com/lhsazevedo/sh4objtest/tree/291be8e458ddc2ecad9c3fd27b4e48a8b17e73aa)
instruction engine and expectation matcher. No PHP packages or background service
are required; PHP 8.3+ and a clean checkout of that revision suffice.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch v0.1.48 https://github.com/lhsazevedo/sh4objtest.git build/sh4objtest
python3 workbench/simulator-pilot/pilot.py --simulator build/sh4objtest --php php
```

On the current Mac the PHP binary is `/opt/homebrew/opt/php@8.3/bin/php`.
Outputs, extracted reference bytes, compiled variants, and jobs stay under
`build/simulator-pilot/`; the final report is `results.json`. The separate
**SH4 simulator pilot** workflow runs this on demand and uploads its report.

## What it establishes

The same cases run against retail, reconstructed C, and deliberately broken C:

- Two device-slot scans: disabled state, empty/full devices, every individual
  slot, blocking sentinel IDs, mixed supported/unsupported types (66 cases).
- Two byte checksums: both tested banks, zero/high-bit/wrapping/ramp/random data,
  and different 80/75-byte extents (18 cases).
- History display: all ten callback positions, register and stack arguments,
  varied history values, and the final status callback (3 cases).
- Recovered `0c12f9d4` callback: inline global flags, countdown boundaries,
  cleanup writes, and indexed dispatch (20 cases).

The suite now has 107 cases and six exercised functions. Its initial three-unit
baseline passed 87 cases and covered 372 native instruction bytes; the recovered
callback adds 20 passing cases and all 98 of its instruction bytes.
Each source mutation compiles and causes an expectation failure:
reversed enable guard, shortened checksum, wrong display coordinate, or early
countdown termination. They fail 52, 10, 3, and 2 cases respectively. A compile error or unsupported instruction
is not accepted as evidence that a mutation was detected.

The initial three-unit baseline took about 14 seconds locally, including compilation and 261 test
executions. It does not measure an overall decompilation speedup. The current
candidates are behaviorally consistent on these cases but remain byte-inexact.
For the tested paths, a current paired pass supports investigating code generation.
Untested paths remain unknown; this does not establish whole-unit behavioral equivalence. Stop using the pilot on a unit once it
is exact; add cases only for a concrete unresolved behavior.

## Reference integrity and limits

The bundled ROM and compiler are verified first. The adapter maps the selected
code and globals from `0x0cxxxxxx` into the simulator's 16 MiB address space.
Only whitelisted pointer words inside reviewed literal pools are rebased in the
reference; each patch is recorded and reversed to verify the original bytes.
Native instructions are never rewritten. The candidate is linked at the same
rebased section address; its actual linked symbol addresses are used, rather
than assuming that mismatching functions retained their original offsets.

Execution uses upstream `Run`, `LinkedProgram`, and expectations directly, so
there is no new instruction interpreter, assembly reconstruction, or object
parser. Memory/register initialization remains randomized except for explicit
case data. A 100,000-instruction budget bounds each case. Full original function
instruction coverage and at least one runtime expectation failure per mutant
are required for this pilot to pass.

Coverage is not proof of all possible behaviors, all branch combinations, or
hardware equivalence. These integer-only routines avoid unverified FPU modes,
interrupts, and device behavior. Callback targets are mocked. The byte comparer,
compiler option sets, registration rules, and progress accounting are unchanged.
No simulator pass earns exact-C credit. Use `--unit ud2_04` (or another unit ID)
to run only an affected unit during recovery. The new callback is tested without
executing the float-using neighbors in its containing unit.

## Selective recovery and freshness

Use an individual unit for a new semantic question, or repeat `--case` to select
exact case names shown in the report:

```sh
python3 workbench/simulator-pilot/pilot.py --simulator build/sh4objtest --unit ud2_04 --case countdown_0_0_2 --php php
python3 tools/diagnose.py src/candidates/ud2_04.c
```

A selected case run need not cover the full function, but still needs a passing
retail/candidate pair and an expectation failure from the deliberate mutant.
A selected case that does not expose that bug produces unknown evidence rather
than a behavioral pass. Whole-unit runs retain the full instruction-coverage
check. Case selection overwrites that unit's evidence with the narrower scope;
other units' records are retained and checked independently for freshness.

`tools/behavioral_evidence.py` exposes read-only `status(unit, report_path=None,
root=ROOT, report=None)` for diagnosis and work selection. It compares current
source, all compiler-visible headers, unit descriptor, case definitions, compiler
binaries/options, runner, compilation code, native program, and pilot/adapter
hashes. It also checks the recorded simulator checkout is still clean at the
reviewed revision. Missing, stale, unsupported, or ineffective mutation-control
results remain unknown. A current failure points to behavior; a current pass
only supports code-generation work on its named tested paths. Evidence does not
become an exact-byte gate and exact units do not require simulator execution.
